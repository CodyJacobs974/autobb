# AutoBugBounty (AutoBB)

AutoBugBounty (AutoBB) is a command-line toolkit designed to assist bug bounty hunters by guiding them through a structured bug bounty workflow. It automates various tasks from reconnaissance to report generation.

## Features (Planned)

*   Target Management: Saves target information and organizes findings.
*   Guided Workflow: Follows a logical bug bounty process:
    *   Reconnaissance
    *   Vulnerability Analysis
    *   Fuzzing & Automation
    *   Exploitation
    *   Report Generation
*   Note-Taking: Allows users to maintain custom notes for each target.
*   Dependency Checking: Will check for required external tools.

## Usage

To run the toolkit:

```bash
python3 autobb.py
```
Or, after ensuring it's executable:
```bash
./autobb.py
```

(Eventually, it might be installable as a system command `autobb`.)

## Directory Structure

When you provide a target and a save location, AutoBB will create a folder structure like this:

```
your_save_location/
└── sanitized_target_name/
    ├── config.txt                # Contains user-entered target & path
    ├── summary.txt              # Final report-style summary (planned)
    ├── recon/
    │   ├── nmap/
    │   ├── subdomains/
    │   ├── gobuster/
    │   ├── wayback/
    │   └── whois/
    ├── vulnerabilities/
    │   ├── xss/
    │   ├── sqli/
    │   ├── ssrf/
    │   ├── open_redirect/
    │   ├── command_injection/
    │   ├── ssti/
    │   ├── insecure_deserialization/
    │   ├── file_upload/
    │   └── security_misconfigurations/
    ├── fuzzing/
    ├── exploitation/
    ├── screenshots/
    └── notes/
        └── user_notes.md (planned)
```
